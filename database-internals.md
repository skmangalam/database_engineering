### ✨ Concept: Clustered Index vs Heap

**Clustered Index:**

* Physically stores table rows in the order of the index.
* Leaf nodes of the B-tree **contain full rows**.
* No separate heap storage. The index *is* the table.
* Common in MySQL (InnoDB) and SQL Server.
* Only one clustered index allowed because only one physical sort order is possible.

**Heap (PostgreSQL):**

* Table is stored as unordered heap pages.
* All indexes are non-clustered and point to heap using TIDs (Tuple IDs).
* Index-only scan optimization only works if visibility map marks page as "all-visible".

**Heap Files and Pages:**

* A PostgreSQL heap table is made of multiple 8KB fixed-size pages.
* Each page contains multiple tuples (rows), but the number of rows depends on row size (not fixed).
* Row location is identified by a CTID = (page number, tuple offset).
* Visibility map is used to determine if a page is fully visible (helps avoid heap fetch in index-only scan).

### 🔌 Why Only One Clustered Index?

* Physical disk layout can only be sorted one way.
* Multiple clustered indexes = multiple full table copies = huge storage + consistency nightmare.

Trade-offs of clustered index:

* ✅ Fast point/range queries
* ❌ Slow inserts/updates if not in index order
* ❌ Can cause page splits
* ❌ Only one per table

---

### 🧵 Index-Only Scan

* Works **only if** all queried columns exist in index.
* PostgreSQL uses visibility map to avoid heap lookup.
* If page not marked "all-visible" → heap access still required.
* Visibility map is updated by autovacuum or manual VACUUM.

---

### 📊 Heap Page & CTID

* Heap is made of 8KB pages.
* Each row has CTID = (page#, row#) to locate tuple.
* You can query rows by CTID directly (low-level access).
* Use `pageinspect` extension in PostgreSQL to read raw page contents.

### 🧠 Logical vs Physical Equality (DB vs Redis)

**PostgreSQL/MySQL (DB):**

* ✅ Source of truth
* ✅ Durable, ACID compliant
* ✅ Schema & constraints
* ✅ Recovers from failure

**Redis/Elastic/Kafka:**

* ❌ Derived copies
* ❌ For performance / availability only
* ❌ Not logically authoritative

> "Physically equal != logically equal."
> Only DB stores logically correct, durable state.

### 🔍 Access Patterns

**Definition:** The way your app frequently queries/reads/writes data.

Examples:

* `SELECT * WHERE id = ?` → point lookup
* `SELECT * WHERE created_at > ?` → time-based range scan
* `ORDER BY name LIMIT 100` → sort + pagination

You optimize for these using:

* Indexes (B-tree, covering, partial)
* Partitioning
* Materialized views
* Denormalized projections (carefully)

❌ Never store same full data multiple times for access patterns — that’s what indexes and views are for.

---

### 🛡️ Golden Rule:

> "Store same data in multiple places only to improve **fault tolerance or availability**, NOT to support access patterns."

---

### ✨ Interview-Ready Line:

> "Caches, indexes, and projections can hold physically equal data, but only the database stores it with logical integrity. It is the only true system of record."
